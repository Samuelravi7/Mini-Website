# Mini-Website
A simple website to replicate a website of a store selling printers

Filezilla Client needs to be installed and connected beforehand before running the codes. Tables should also be prepared beforehand to link with the database. The email and password to the login page would be :
User ID : S201
Password : sam123

Link to website : http://localhost/mypt3/login.php

The database table will be uploaded in the future after further enhancements of the website
